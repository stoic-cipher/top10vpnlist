          We're tired of VPN review sites that all recommend the same 5 VPNs regardless of what's actually best for users.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Problem with VPN Review Sites</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        If you've searched for "best VPN" recently, you've noticed something: <strong>every site ranks ExpressVPN #1.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Why? Because ExpressVPN pays <strong>$40 per sale</strong> in affiliate commissions. NordVPN pays $30. Surfshark pays $35.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        These sites aren't ranking VPNs based on quality—they're ranking them by commission rate. The "testing" is often fabricated, and the reviews are identical across hundreds of affiliate sites.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Approach: Privacy First</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We focus on VPNs that are <strong>actually good for privacy</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Mullvad</strong> - Used by the Tor Project, anonymous accounts, audited</li>
        <li><strong>IVPN</strong> - Transparent ownership, ethical practices, audited</li>
        <li><strong>ProtonVPN</strong> - Swiss privacy, created by CERN scientists</li>
        <li><strong>AirVPN</strong> - 10+ year track record, beloved by power users</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        These aren't the VPNs that pay the highest commissions. They're the ones that are <strong>actually trustworthy</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Standards</h2>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">✓ We Test VPNs Ourselves</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We actually subscribe and test speed, privacy features, and real-world usage. Not just copy-paste from press releases.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">✓ We Prioritize Privacy</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We recommend VPNs based on jurisdiction, audit reports, and transparency—not commission rates.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">✓ We're Honest About Trade-offs</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          No VPN is perfect. We explain what you're giving up with each choice (speed vs privacy, price vs features, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">✓ We Disclose Affiliates</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Yes, we earn commissions. But we're transparent about it and never let money dictate our rankings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Why We Don't Recommend ExpressVPN</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        ExpressVPN is fast and user-friendly, but there are serious concerns:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Owned by Kape Technologies</strong> - Former malware distributor that now owns 30+ VPNs</li>
        <li><strong>Expensive</strong> - $6.67/mo vs. Mullvad's €5/mo (better privacy)</li>
        <li><strong>Questionable audits</strong> - Audited by PwC (paid by ExpressVPN's parent company)</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing over substance</strong> - Spends more on ads than R&D</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        We'd rather recommend Mullvad, which is used by security researchers, has a proven no-logs policy, and accepts anonymous cash payments.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">VPN Ownership: The Truth</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Most users don't realize that <strong>a handful of companies own most VPNs</strong>:
      </p>

      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 mb-8">
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-800">
          <li><strong>Kape Technologies:</strong> ExpressVPN, CyberGhost, Private Internet Access, Zenmate, and 20+ others</li>
          <li><strong>Nord Security:</strong> NordVPN, Surfshark, AtlasVPN</li>
          <li><strong>Ziff Davis:</strong> IPVanish, StrongVPN, Encrypt.me, Perimeter81</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        We prioritize independently owned VPNs: Mullvad (Swedish), IVPN (Gibraltar), ProtonVPN (Swiss), AirVPN (Italian activists).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        To be the <strong>anti-affiliate-site</strong>: honest, transparent, and actually helpful.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We'd rather earn your trust and make modest affiliate commissions than trick you into buying overpriced VPNs you don't need.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        If you find value in our honest approach, use our affiliate links. If not, that's okay—just find a VPN that actually protects your privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">How We Make Money</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Full transparency:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Affiliate commissions</strong> - We earn $3-20 per sale depending on the VPN</li>
        <li><strong>No ads</strong> - We don't run banner ads or sell user data</li>
        <li><strong>No sponsored posts</strong> - VPN companies can't pay for better rankings</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Mullvad pays the lowest commission (~€3/sale), yet we rank it #1. That should tell you something.
      </p>
