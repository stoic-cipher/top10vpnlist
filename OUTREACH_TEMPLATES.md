# Backlink Outreach Templates

## General Principles

1. **Personalize**: Always reference something specific from their site
2. **Provide Value**: Lead with what you can offer them, not what you want
3. **Be Brief**: Keep emails under 150 words
4. **No Attachments**: Never send unsolicited attachments
5. **Follow Up Once**: If no response in 7 days, send one polite follow-up
