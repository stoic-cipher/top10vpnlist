# News Jacking Strategy for VPN Site

## What is News Jacking?

News jacking is the practice of creating timely content around breaking news to capitalize on high search volume and social sharing. When a major data breach or privacy scandal hits, people immediately search for information and solutionsâ€”this is when you publish your take and offer VPN solutions.

## Why It Works

1. **Immediate Search Volume**: Breaking news creates instant search demand
2. **Low Competition**: You have 24-48 hours before major sites cover it
3. **Natural Backlinks**: Journalists and bloggers link to early comprehensive coverage
4. **Social Shares**: Timely content gets shared more than evergreen content
5. **Establishes Authority**: Being first shows you're actively monitoring the space

## News Alerts to Set Up

### Google Alerts

- "VPN data breach"

- "privacy law passed"
- "VPN blocked"
- "internet censorship"

- "VPN vulnerability"
- "Five Eyes" OR "Nine Eyes" OR "Fourteen Eyes"
- "warrant canary"

## Content Refresh Strategy

Update news articles every 3 months:

1. Add "Update [Date]:" section at top

3. Update "dateModified" in Schema markup
4. Re-promote on social media: "Updated analysis: [Event]"

Fresh content signals to Google that you're actively maintaining the article, which helps rankings.

## Legal Considerations

- **Never claim**: "This VPN would have prevented the breach" (unless provably true)
- **Always say**: "VPNs can help protect against [specific threat]" (qualified claims)
- **Avoid**: Fearmongering or exaggerating threats
- **Include**: Honest limitations ("VPNs don't protect against...")

- **Feedly**: RSS feed reader for privacy blogs (free tier)
- **TweetDeck**: Monitor Twitter hashtags and accounts (free)

## Remember

News jacking is about **speed + quality**. You don't need perfect proseâ€”you need accurate information published fast. Get the facts right, offer genuine value, and recommend VPNs honestly based on the specific threat.

The goal isn't to exploit fearâ€”it's to educate people during moments when they're actively seeking privacy solutions.
